This repo contains some solutions to the python challenge at http://www.pythonchallenge.com/ 

All code was written by Chris Baldwin circa 2014
I used the python challenge as a way of getting comfortable with the python stdlib.

If you are interested in the python challenge, I highly suggest not reading my solutions.
It is more fun to come up with a solution than to copy someone elses.

Cheers,
Chris
